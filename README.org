#+TITLE: BIND2Excel

*You probably won't like or want what you may find here.*

This Perl code parses BIND 9 configuration files and zone files and writes a corresponding file in Microsoft Excel format. It was intended to be a small /ad hoc/ endeavor to simplify the conveyance of basic, frequently changing DNS information to management. It worked because most of the BIND configuration had been programmatically generated and followed a fairly consistent format. It doesn't support IPv6 addresses and probably isn't easily adaptable to other formatting conventions because...well, just /look/ at it. It did meet the requirements, but I'm not sure it was the simplest thing that could possibly work.

I'm glad I no longer do things like this, but I'll publicly admit responsibility for this one.
